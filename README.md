# ü§ñ OpenInterviewAI: Adaptive Technical Mock Interview Platform

OpenInterviewAI is an open-source, LLM-powered system that simulates a
highly skilled, adaptive human interviewer. Built using the Ollama
framework for flexible model execution, it dynamically generates an
interview plan based on a job description, conducts the interview using
natural language and voice (Kokoro TTS), and provides detailed,
objective feedback.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üåü Features

-   **Adaptive Flow (LLM-Driven):** Real-time monitoring and dynamic
    adjustment of the conversation (repeat, clarify, next topic) based
    on the candidate's response quality, managed entirely by the
    integrated LLM logic.\
-   **Voice-Enabled Interviewer:** Integrates Kokoro TTS for natural,
    realistic audio interaction.\
-   **Targeted Planning:** Perplixica pre-processes job descriptions to
    ensure the generated questions are highly relevant to the required
    competencies, with core logic provided by the LLM.\
-   **Metric-Based Feedback:** Provides detailed metrics (accuracy,
    confidence, relevance, completeness, clarity) for every response,
    using the LLM for objective assessment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture: The Adaptive Loop

The entire system runs as a continuous loop, with the **Monitor** acting
as the central decision engine that dictates the flow.

### LLM Integration Notes

All core components rely on a **Large Language Model (LLM)** for
processing, generation, and assessment.\
This project is configured to use the **Ollama framework** for local and
flexible model management, ensuring the platform remains open-source and
customizable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup and Dependencies

To get OpenInterviewAI running, you need the core application and the
external voice service.

### 1. Core Repository Setup

Clone the project:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

Install Python dependencies:

``` bash
# It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure LLM and Environment:

-   **Ollama Setup:** Ensure the Ollama service is installed and running
    locally on its default port (`http://localhost:11434`). The
    application connects directly to the Ollama API endpoint.\
-   **Model Selection:** Specify the LLM model name (e.g., `mistral`,
    `llama3`) in the application's configuration (usually via an
    environment variable like `LLM_MODEL_NAME`).\
-   **Kokoro TTS:** Set the local endpoint for the Kokoro TTS service
    (`KOKORO_TTS_URL`).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Voice Feature Integration (Kokoro TTS)

The **Interviewer** component uses the **Kokoro TTS Web UI** for
generating natural voice output.

-   Install Kokoro TTS Web UI:\
    Follow the installation and setup guide for the Kokoro TTS Web UI
    project.\
-   Ensure the service is running on the port configured in your
    environment variables.\
-   Apply Custom Integration:\
    This repository includes a custom application file (e.g., `app.py`
    in the main directory) that contains the necessary logic to
    communicate with and control the Kokoro TTS service. Ensure your
    running TTS instance is configured to use this custom application
    logic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîÅ Operational Flow Walkthrough

The detailed step-by-step logic is critical for contributors to
understand how the system manages the conversation dynamically.
